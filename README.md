## Projects

### The Password Manager
- Description: Have you ever wished there existed a program that would remember your passwords for you, because you keep forgetting them? Well here it is. The Password Manager can store your passwords for you so that you won't ever have to worry about losing them! But how does it store them and can a person not acquire that password you might ask, they cannot! The passwords are stored in an encrypted format and can only be decrypted if the user has the master key. Apart from that, it can also generate you a secure password for your accounts.
  The module is currently under development, and I will publish the final work soon. For encryption, I am using the encrypt library on Python, but I am willing to create my own encryption algorithm for it (maybe a project for the future). If you want to suggest anything, feel free to email me!
